# MATLAB-function-to-implement-a-continuous-time-signal-pulse-t-
Write a MATLAB function to implement a continuous time signal “pulse(t)” defined as follows: see fig.1

The MATLAB function pulse(t) should accept a 1 by N row vector t as input and output a 1 by N row vector of corresponding values of the signal at the time instants specified in the t vector. Plot the following signals pulse(t), pulse(1-t) and pulse(2t+3) using the plot command. Check the correctness of your output by manually plotting the above signals. MATLAB CODE Editor

I tried my level best to reduce for loops and i have used  vectorisation .
